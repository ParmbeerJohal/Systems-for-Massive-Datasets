# Systems-for-Massive-Datasets

## Course Overview
This course covers methods and techniques for managing, analysing, and mining large amounts of data in secondary and/or distributed storage.

The objective of the course is to present the technology from which modern data analytics systems are built. After taking the course, the students will be able to understand the trade-offs involved in designing algorithms for managing, mining, and summarizing large-scale data. Another objective of the course is to introduce the students to new computing paradigms like Map-Reduce and Spark for utilizing large clusters of machines in a failure-resilient way while achieving great scalability for handling large-scale data.

## Topics:
- Storage mechanics for big data
- Extensible hash tables
- Multidimensional indexes (e.g. Quad-Trees, RTrees)
- Inverted Indexes (for web documents)
- Map-Reduce, Spark
- Finding similar items (minhashing, locality-sensitive hashing)
- Mining Data Streams
- Social network analysis with a focus on big social-graphs
